Obesity

"I just started the medication this week. I&#039;ve had three shots so far.  I was really worried about the needles but you honestly don&#039;t feel a thing.  I didn&#039;t even feel a pinch when I did the injection.   I do feel a bit tired. I have a very dull headache.     I do have a little bit of  nausea.   I have been injecting in my upper thigh where there&#039;s plenty of fat. (Lol).   My appetite  has decreased so I have to keep an eye on my emotional eating.  I am a former gastric bypass patient  trying to lose the last 30 pounds. The first hundred was easy. So far so good."
